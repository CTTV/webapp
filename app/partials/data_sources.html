                    <p>We collect data from various sources and combine them into categories called Data types to allow for target identification and prioritisation using our Target Validation platform. We list our current data types and their data sources below. Note that data from an individual source can contribute to different Data types, e.g. data from EVA is observed in two data types, Genetic associations and Somatic mutations.</p>

                <div class="cttv-docs-section">
                    <h4><a name="genetic"></a>Genetic associations</h4>
                    <p>Genetic associations are available for both common and rare (Mendelian) diseases and come from the following sources.</p>

                    <h5><a name="gwas"></a>GWAS Catalog</h5>
                    <p>The NHGRI-EBI <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/about">GWAS catalog</a> provides evidence on the association of genes (targets) and common diseases. This data comes from the manual curation of published Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). The catalog gives a list of the genetic variants (e.g. SNPs) that are most associated with a disease, by genomic region from each study. We include all associations with p-values â‰¤ 10-5, so that we broaden the coverage of diseases. The association between a disease and its most likely gene is determined by assessing the link between variant and gene using the Open Targets custom annotation pipeline. Variants are assigned to a gene by first considering any deleterious consequence within the coding region of that gene, followed by whether the variant is located within introns or regulatory regions, and finally if the variant is intergenic it will be assigned to the promoter region of the nearest gene. The consequences of these variants are annotated using the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html">Variant Effect Predictor</a></p>

                    <h5><a name="uniprot"></a>UniProt</h5>
                    <p>The Universal Protein Resource (<a href="http://www.uniprot.org">UniProt</a>) provides protein sequence and functional information manually curated from the literature and public databases. It curates associations between genes and rare (Mendelian) diseases if deleterious variants in the coding region of a gene are observed in patients and are segregating within their families.</p>

                    <h5><a name="uniprot_lit"></a>UniProt literature</h5>
                    <p>UniProt also curates associations between genes and rare (Mendelian) diseases even in the absence of deleterious variants in the coding region of the gene. We classified the source of these genetic associations as UniProt Literature.</p>

                    <h5><a name="eva"></a>European Variation Archive (EVA)</h5>
                    <p>The EMBL-EBI <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/?Home">European Variation Archive</a> (EVA) is a database of publicly available genetic variants, both short scale (e.g. SNPs) and large structural variants (e.g. larger deletions). For rare (Mendelian) diseases, EVA provides clinically relevant data for the variants that are pathogenic or likely pathogenic. This clinical information comes from the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/">ClinVar</a>, and includes <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim"></a>OMIM data.</p>

                    <h5><a name="decipher"></a>DECIPHER</h5>
                    <p>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute <a href="https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/index">DECIPHER</a> is a database of genomic variants and phenotypes in patients with developmental disorders. Genetic variants are both short scale (i.e. sequence variants such as SNPs) or large structural variants (e.g. copy number variants). The data is combined with several other bioinformatics resources that are relevant to the variants found in their cohort of patients.</p>

                <div class="cttv-docs-section">
                    <h4><a name="somatic"></a>Somatic mutations</h4>
                    <p>Somatic mutation data refers to mutations that may have clinical or treatment implications in Cancer and possibly other diseases. This data type is obtained from the following sources:</p>

                    <h5><a name="census"></a>The Cancer Gene Census</h5>
                    <p>The <a href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic">COSMIC</a> COSMIC Cancer Gene Census at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute provides a catalogue of genes for which mutations have been causally implicated in cancer. It provides evidence on manually curated mutations likely to be cancer drivers.</p>

                    <h5><a name="eva_somatic"></a>EVA</h5>
                    <p>The EMBL-EBI <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/?Home">European Variation Archive</a> (EVA) provides data on somatic mutations in both cancer and other diseases.</p>

                    <h5><a name="intogen"></a>IntOGen</h5>
                    <p><a href="http://bg.upf.edu/group/tools.php#intogen">IntOGen</a> provides somatic mutations, genes and pathways involved in tumorigenesis. Their current release (2014.12) comprises data from 4,623 exomes from 13 cancer larger consortia, such as International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). </p>

                    <h5><a name="chembl"></a>ChEMBL</h5>
                    <p>The EMBL-EBI <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/">ChEMBL</a> database provides evidence from known drugs where the drug can be connected to a disease and a known target. ChEMBL is an open access database that contains compound bioactivity data against drug targets. Currently, data on FDA-approved, marketed drugs (i.e. those which are approved for clinical trials in the USA) are being displayed. Clinical indication data from other countries is being reviewed and processed.</p>

In addition Atlas provides baseline expression information for each gene in the target profile page.</p>

                    <p>This data type contains evidence of target-disease association which is extracted automatically by mining the following literature database:</p>

                    <h5><a name="epmc"></a>Europe PMC</h5>
                    <p>The Europe PubMed Central (<a href="http://europepmc.org/">Europe PMC</a>) provides evidence of links between genes and diseases by mining the titles, abstracts and full text research articles from both PubMed and PubMed Central, and it uses an entity-to-entity recognition approach to detect co-occurrences of target and disease entities.</p>
                </div>

                    <h4><a name="mouse"></a>Animal models</h4>
                    <p>Model organisms are a valuable source for the characterisation and identification of disease-gene associations, especially when the molecular basis and/or function of the candidate gene are unknown. We use the following data source:</p>

                    <p>The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/databases/phenodigm/">PhenoDigm</a> database provides evidence on associations of targets and disease. It uses a semantic approach to map between clinical features observed in humans and mouse phenotype annotations.  The phenotypic effects in mice are then mapped to phenotypes associated with human diseases, and matches are identified and scored.</p>
