## Variant Definitions


|Variant term |Definition|
|-------------|----------|
|3 prime UTR variant |A UTR variant of the 3' UTR.|
|5 prime UTR variant |A UTR variant of the 5' UTR.|
|coding sequence variant|A sequence variant that changes the coding sequence.|
|frameshift variant |A sequence variant which causes a disruption of the translational reading frame, because the number of nucleotides inserted or deleted is not a multiple of three.|
|inframe deletion |An inframe non synonymous variant that deletes bases from the coding sequence.|
|inframe insertion |An inframe non synonymous variant that inserts bases into in the coding sequence.|
|initiator codon variant | A codon variant that changes at least one base of the first codon of a transcript.|
|intron variant | A transcript variant occurring within an intron.|
|missense variant | A sequence variant that changes one or more bases, resulting in a different amino acid sequence but where the length is preserved.|
|nearest gene counting from 5' end | Nearest gene to variant counting from 5' end.|
|non coding transcript exon variant | A sequence variant that changes non-coding exon sequence in a non-coding transcript.|
|regulatory region variant | A sequence variant located within a regulatory region.|
|splice acceptor variant | A splice variant that changes the 2 base region at the 3' end of an intron.|
|splice donor variant | A splice variant that changes the 2 base pair region at the 5' end of an intron.|
|splice region variant | A sequence variant in which a change has occurred within the region of the splice site, either within 1-3 bases of the exon or 3-8 bases of the intron.|
|stop gained | A sequence variant whereby at least one base of a codon is changed, resulting in a premature stop codon, leading to a shortened transcript.|
|stop lost | A sequence variant where at least one base of the terminator codon (stop) is changed, resulting in an elongated transcript.|
|stop retained variant | A sequence variant where at least one base in the terminator codon is changed, but the terminator remains.|
|synonymous variant | A sequence variant where there is no resulting change to the encoded amino acid.|
|upstream gene variant | A sequence variant located 5' of a gene.|
