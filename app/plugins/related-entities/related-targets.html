    The top 20 targets related to {{entitySymbol}} based on a computation of similar target-to-disease connections and overall association scores. 
    Clicking on a related target bubble will show you a list of the diseases used to calculate the similarity between the two targets. 
    For more information on this visualisation and how we compute similarity scores, please read <a href="https://docs.targetvalidation.org/faq/how-do-you-compute-target-and-disease-similarity" target="_blank">our documentation on target and disease similarity</a>.
