The data in [Gene2Phenotype](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gene2phenotype) (G2P) is produced and curated from the literature by consultant clinical geneticists in the UK. This data is comprised of both short scale (i.e. sequence variants such as SNPs) and large structural variants (e.g. copy number variants), and can allow targeted filtering of genome-wide data for diagnostic purposes. The variants were provided by [DECIPHER](https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk/index), a database of genomic variants and phenotypes in patients with developmental disorders.
