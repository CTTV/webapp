The [PheWAS](https://phewascatalog.org) (phenome-wide association studies) resources provide associations between a genetic variant and multiple phenotypes. It contains clinical phenotypes derived from the electronic medical record (EMR)-linked DNA biobank BioVU by the Center for Precision Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The EMR-based PheWAS uses ICD9 (International Classification of Disease, 9th edition), which were mapped to EFO using [](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/index)OLS and [](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/zooma/)Zooma. The catalog contains all associations with p < 0.05 (uncorrected).
