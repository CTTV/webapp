The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute [PhenoDigm](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/tools/phenodigm) database provides evidence on associations of targets and disease. It uses a semantic approach to map between clinical features observed in humans and mouse phenotype annotations. The phenotypic effects in mice are then mapped to phenotypes associated with human diseases, and matches are identified and scored.
