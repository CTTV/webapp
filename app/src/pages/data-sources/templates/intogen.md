[IntOGen](http://www.intogen.org/search) provides somatic mutations, genes and pathways involved in tumorigenesis. We have imported the latest data from 6,792 samples across 28 cancer types ([Rubio-Perez et al](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25759023)). In these new dataset, false mutation calls have been filtered out and additional expression data is available for a larger number of samples in certain tumour types. This IntOgen analysis is updated and has not yet been released on the IntOgen website; so there can be discrepancies between targetvalidation.org and the IntOgen site.
