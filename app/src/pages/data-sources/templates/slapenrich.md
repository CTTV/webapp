[SLAPenrich](https://saezlab.github.io/SLAPenrich/) (Sample-population Level Analysis of Pathway enrichments) is a novel statistical framework for the identification of significantly mutated pathways, at the sample population level, in large cohorts of cancer patients. It is based on a Poisson binomial model that takes into account the length of blocks of exons in genes within each pathway, and the background mutation rate of the analysed cohort of patients. We include in our Open Targets Platform the data obtained using SLAPenrich on somatic mutations from the The Cancer Genome Atlas across 25 different cancer types and a collection of pathway gene sets from Reactome.
