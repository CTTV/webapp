Cancer Gene Census is a catalogue of genes for which mutations have been causally implicated in cancer. The Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer ([COSMIC](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic)) at the Wellcome Sanger Institute provides us with the set of genes associated with specific cancers in the Cancer Gene Census, in addition to other cancers associated with that gene in the COSMIC database.
