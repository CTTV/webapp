The EMBL-EBI [European Variation Archive](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/eva/?Home) (EVA) is a database of publicly available genetic variants, both short scale (e.g. SNPs) and large structural variants (e.g. larger deletions). For rare (Mendelian) diseases, EVA provides clinically relevant data for the variants that are pathogenic or likely pathogenic. This clinical information comes from [ClinVar](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/), and includes [](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim)OMIM data.
